# Venetian Blinds Gallery

This is a project in which I merge together my `Cat Whisperer` project, `Speech Synthesis`, `audio`, and a cool `venetian blinds` animation effect I'm applying to my images of Percy. I will probably be adding even more things (as well as my `gulp workflow` AND `webpack 2+`), but this is as much as I know for now.

I have been trying to figure out how to merge the images of Percy, the music I chose to fit the images, and the `Speech Synthesis API`. I think I've finally got it!
