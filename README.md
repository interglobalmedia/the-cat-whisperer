# The Cat Whisperer

This is a project in which I merge together my `Cat Whisperer` project, `Speech Synthesis`, `audio`, and a cool image fader animation effect I'm applying to my images of my (late cat) Percy.

## Refactoring The App
January 8, 2019: A lot has happened in terms of JS workflows since I created this app. Since I want to potentially develop this app further, as well as display it in my portfolio, I knew I had to update the code here. That ***especially*** means updating the workflow!

So I have applied an adaptation of my latest React workflow using Webpack 4 and Babel 7 to this application. A whole new set of tools for automation!

I also wrote a quick piece on my experience refacoring this app (yesterday) that is available for your reading pleasure on my Developer Blog.
